      <description>Starting the struggle of life at a very early stage, I have traversed the tough road to success through myriad experiences and experiments. In the quest for success, I ventured into many enterprises, some of which met with huge success while others were moderate. Through these enterprises, I have come across thousands of people, a few successful and still rising on the path of success, and others merely dragging on with their lives.</description>
